# Pult

Access local servers on .dev domains.

## How do I use it?

```
~ $ pult-server
node-project $ pult node app # available at http://node-project.dev/
ruby-project $ pult rackup   # available at http://ruby-project.dev/
```

## How do I get it?

```
npm install -g pult
```

## How do I use it even more?

```
node-project $ pult -n my-project node app # available at http://my-project.dev/
node-project $ echo "my-project" > .pult
node-project $ pult node app               # available at http://my-project.dev/
```

## How does it work?

1. `pult-server` spawns itself with `sudo`
2. `pult-server` starts a DNS server
3. `pult-server` adds itself to `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. `pult-server` starts an HTTP server
5. `pult` requests port for current working directory
  1. `pult-server` finds or assigns a new port for the domain
  2. `pult-server` begins responding to DNS requests for the domain
  3. `pult-server` begins reverse-proxying HTTP for the domain to the
     port
  4. `pult-server` returns the port to `pult`
6. `pult` sets the `PORT` environment variable
7. `pult` spawns `node app`
