# Pult

Access local servers on .dev domains.

## How do I get it?

```
npm install -g pult
```

## How do I use it?

```
~ $ pult-server
node-project $ pult node app # available at http://node-project.dev
ruby-project $ pult rackup   # available at http://ruby-project.dev
```

### Custom domains

By default, Pult uses the name of the current directory to determine
what `.dev` domain to serve from. You can specify a different domain
using the `-n` option:

```
node-project $ pult -n my-project node app # available at http://my-project.dev
```

You can also set the domain in the `.pult` file of the current
directory:

```
node-project $ echo 'my-project' > .pult
node-project $ pult node app # available at http://my-project.dev
```

### Subdomains

Pult also serves the same application on all subdomains of its `.dev`
domain. For example, `node-project` will be available at
`http://node-project.dev`, `http://www.node-project.dev`,
`http://assets.node-project.dev`, etc.

Pult also allows you to serve different applications on subdomains
simply by specifying the subdomain with `-n` or in the `.pult` file:

```
other-project $ pult -n other.node-project node app # available at http://other.node-project.dev
```

## How does it work?

1. `pult-server` spawns itself with `sudo`
2. `pult-server` starts a DNS server
3. `pult-server` adds itself to `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. `pult-server` starts an HTTP server
5. `pult` requests port for current working directory
  1. `pult-server` finds or assigns a new port for the domain
  2. `pult-server` begins responding to DNS requests for the domain
  3. `pult-server` begins reverse-proxying HTTP for the domain to the
     port
  4. `pult-server` returns the port to `pult`
6. `pult` sets the `PORT` environment variable
7. `pult` spawns `node app`
