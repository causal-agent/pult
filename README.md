# Pult

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pult.svg)][npm]

[npm]: https://npmjs.com/package/pult

Access local servers on .dev domains.

View the [documentation](http://cmcenroe.me/pult) for more detailed
information.

## How do I get it?

```
npm install pult
```

## How do I use it?

Pult can either be used as a library from within your Node HTTP app, or
from the command line for use with other HTTP servers.

### As a Library

See the [library documentation](http://cmcenroe.me/pult/index.html) for
more information.

```js
var pult = require('pult');
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

pult.getPort('my-app', function(err, port, domain) {
  if (err) throw err;
  server.listen(port);
  console.log('http://' + domain); // http://my-app.dev
});
```

This example assumes that the Pult server is running. For more detailed
examples and better practices, see the [example
documentation](http://cmcenroe.me/pult/example.html).

### From the Command Line

```
npm install -g pult
```

Running `pult` from the command line automatically spawns `pult-server`
if it is not already running.

```sh
ruby-project $ pult rackup # http://ruby-project.dev
other-project $ pult foreman start # http://other-project.dev
```

By default, Pult sets the `PORT` environment variable then spawns your
server process. If your server process takes a port using the `-p` or
`-P` options rather than through `PORT`, simply pass the required option
to Pult:

```sh
website $ pult -P jekyll serve # http://website.dev
```

For more details about the command line implementation, see the [command
line documentation](http://cmcenroe.me/pult/pult.html).

#### Custom domains

By default, Pult uses the name of the current directory to determine
what `.dev` domain to serve from. You can specify a different domain
using the `-n` option:

```sh
node-project $ pult -n my-project node app # http://my-project.dev
```

#### Subdomains

Pult also serves the same application on all subdomains of its `.dev`
domain. For example, `node-project` will be available at
`http://node-project.dev`, `http://www.node-project.dev`, etc.

Pult also allows you to serve different applications on subdomains
simply by specifying the subdomain with `-n`:

```sh
other-project $ pult -n other.project node app # http://other.project.dev
```

#### Configuration

Pult interprets the contents of `.pultrc` in the current directory as
command-line arguments. This allows saving the domain name and command
to run so that bringing a server up on a `.dev` domain is as simple as
running `pult`.

```sh
node-project $ echo "-n my-project node app" > .pultrc
node-project $ pult # node app on http://my-project.dev
```

#### Status

To find out which domains are being forwarded to which ports, simply run
`pult` with no arguments:

```sh
~ $ pult
[pult] next: 7003
[pult] http://node-project.dev --> http://localhost:7001
[pult] http://ruby-project.dev --> http://localhost:7002
```

#### Output

`pult` logs to standard error prefixed with `[pult]`. To disable
logging, pass the `-q` option.

### Server

By default, `pult-server` respawns itself with sudo then forks to the
background. To run `pult-server` as a foreground process, pass the `-f`
option:

```sh
~ $ pult-server -f
```

To stop `pult-server` while it is running in the background, pass the
`-k` option to `pult`:

```sh
~ $ pult-server
~ $ pult -k
```

The default first port that `pult-server` assigns is 7001. To change
this port, pass the `-p` option:

```sh
~ $ pult-server -p 8081
~ $ pult
[pult] next: 8081
```

By default, `pult-server` binds to ports 53 (DNS) and 80 (HTTP) on
`127.0.0.1` (IPv4 localhost). If you are already running these services
on `127.0.0.1` and are using a system that allows the use of the entire
`127.0.0.0/8` range, you can pass the `-l` option to change which host
`pult-server` binds to:

```sh
~ $ pult-server -l 127.1.1.1
```

For more details on the server implementation, see the [server
documentation](http://cmcenroe.me/pult/server.html).

## Similar projects

* [Pow](http://pow.cx/)
  * Advantages:
    * Runs as regular user
    * Allows serving the same application from multiple domains (not
      just subdomains)
  * Disadvantages:
    * OS X only
    * Rack-specific
    * Requires symlinking (explicit setup)
    * Takes over control of your server processes

## Compatibility

Pult is compatible with Linux systems using `/etc/resolv.conf` and with
Mac OS X using `/etc/resolver`.
