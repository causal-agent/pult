[npm]: https://npmjs.com/package/pult

Access local servers on .dev domains.

Pult makes local app servers available on `.dev` domains by running a local DNS
server and HTTP reverse-proxy.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g pult
```

## Usage

```sh
node-project $ pult npm start # http://node-project.dev
ruby-project $ pult rackup # http://ruby-project.dev
jekyll-site $ pult -P jekyll serve # http://jekyll-site.dev
static-site $ pult -s # http://static-site.dev
```

Pult will first launch its server if it is not already running, then launch the
app server.

By default, Pult passes the port to the server process through the `PORT`
environment variable. Passing `--port`, `-p` or `-P` passes the port through the
corresponding option (required for Jekyll).

For static sites, the `-s` option starts a static HTTP server in the current
directory.

### Domains

Pult by default serves the app from a `.dev` domain of the current directory.
This can be changed with the `-n` option:

```sh
pult -n example # http://example.dev
```

Pult also serves the app on any subdomain of the `.dev` domain. To serve
different apps on subdomains, pass the subdomain with `-n`.

### Configuration

Command line options can be saved in `.pultrc` files that will be read from the
current directory.

```sh
echo "-n example npm start" > .pultrc
pult # http://example.dev
```

### Status

Invoking `pult` with no arguments lists the domains Pult is serving and the
local ports they are being forwarded to.

```
[pult] next: 7003
[pult] http://example.dev --> http://localhost:7001
[pult] http://static.dev --> http://localhost:7002
```

### Server

The Pult Server consists of a DNS server for resolving `.dev` domains and an
HTTP server to reverse-proxy the `.dev` domains to app servers.

`pult` will launch `pult-server` automatically, but it can also be run manually.

The default behavior is for `pult-server` to respawn itself with `sudo`, then
fork to the background. To run `pult-server` in the foreground, pass `-f`.

```sh
pult-server -f
```

To stop `pult-server` while it is in the background, pass `-k` to `pult`.

```sh
pult-server
pult -k
```

The default first port that `pult-server` assigns is 7001. This can be changed
by passing `-p`.

```sh
pult-server -p 8081
```

The default bind address of `pult-server` for both DNS (port 53) and HTTP (port
80) is `127.0.0.1`. A different address can be passed with the `-l` option.

```sh
pult-server -l 127.1.1.1
```

### Library

Pult can be used as a Node.js library. See the [documentation][docs].
