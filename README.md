# Pult [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/pult.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/pult)

Access local servers on .dev domains.

## How do I get it?

```
npm install -g pult
```

## How do I use it?

```sh
~ $ pult-server
node-project $ pult node app # available at http://node-project.dev
ruby-project $ pult rackup   # available at http://ruby-project.dev
```

By default, Pult sets the `PORT` environment variable then spawns your
server process. If your server process takes a port using the `-p` or
`-P` options rather than through `PORT`, simply pass the required option
to Pult:

```sh
website $ pult -P jekyll serve
```

### Custom domains

By default, Pult uses the name of the current directory to determine
what `.dev` domain to serve from. You can specify a different domain
using the `-n` option:

```sh
node-project $ pult -n my-project node app # available at http://my-project.dev
```

You can also set the domain in the `.pult` file of the current
directory:

```sh
node-project $ echo 'my-project' > .pult
node-project $ pult node app # available at http://my-project.dev
```

### Subdomains

Pult also serves the same application on all subdomains of its `.dev`
domain. For example, `node-project` will be available at
`http://node-project.dev`, `http://www.node-project.dev`, etc.

Pult also allows you to serve different applications on subdomains
simply by specifying the subdomain with `-n` or in the `.pult` file:

```sh
other-project $ pult -n other.project node app # available at http://other.project.dev
```

### Status

To find out which domains are being forwarded to which ports, simply run
`pult` with no arguments:

```sh
~ $ pult
pult.dev 80
node-project.dev 7000
ruby-project.dev 7001
```

### Server

By default, `pult-server` spawns itself with sudo then forks to the
background. To run `pult-server` as a foreground process, pass the `-f`
option:

```sh
~ $ pult-server -f
```

To stop `pult-server` while it is running in the background, pass the
`-k` option to `pult`:

```sh
~ $ pult-server
~ $ pult -k
```

## How does it work?

1. `pult-server` spawns itself with `sudo`
2. `pult-server` starts a DNS server
3. `pult-server` adds itself to `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. `pult-server` starts an HTTP server
5. `pult` requests a port for the application
  1. `pult-server` finds or assigns a new port for the domain
  2. `pult-server` begins responding to DNS queries for the domain
  3. `pult-server` begins reverse-proxying HTTP for the domain to the
     port
  4. `pult-server` returns the port to `pult`
6. `pult` sets the `PORT` environment variable
7. `pult` spawns `node app`

Pult assigns ports sequentially starting from 7000.

  * Advantages:
    * Runs as regular user
    * Allows serving the same application from multiple domains (not
      just subdomains)
  * Disadvantages:
    * OS X only
    * Rack-specific
    * Requires symlinking (explicit setup)
    * Takes over control of your server processes

## Compatibility

Pult has been tested on:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Mac OS X 10.9.1
* Arch Linux (2014-01-26)
